Phone interview: the same process is applied for all roles :) doesn't matter what kind of role u apply for...

- leveling is done by Amazon :) 
- no need to turn on camera 
- collaborative: solve with the engineer
- 35-40m coding 20m 5 Q&A
- 1 or 2 coding problems - computer science fundamentals
- any languages :) 
- ask clarify questions (always) -> thinking through -> communicate through (why, edge cases) -> start implementing -> clean code -> testing with couple of samples -> interview gives hints (guide to the right answer) -> no need to compile -> work on medium categories :)

Behaviral:
- past experience align to princicples
- working project deadline
- dive deep to solve problem 
- bad feedbacks
- did learn from failures :) 
- grew or changed from the failures
- big impacts :) 
- 10 stories cover all scenarios
- 2-3 behaviral questions :) 
- STAR format
- tangible result :) metrics, numbers, backed by data
- how did u do differently? 

=> within 2 days - 6 months
