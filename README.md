# Everything You Need For Coding Interviews

This is a notebook I'm using to take note when practicing for coding interviews. It helps me crack the coding interviews at: Amazon, Meta (Facebook), Google, Snapchat, Datadog, Reddit, Tiktok,...

### TL;DR - how to use this repo?
1. Read [README.md](README.md)
2. Follow suggested links in the README - [Data Structure and Algorithms Courses](#data-structure-and-algorithms-courses) section to learn data structures & algorithms
3. Try implementing data structures & algorithms in the language of choice. Sample code in Python can be found in [source/algorithms](source/algorithms/) and [source/data_structure](source/data_structure/) folders
3. After having a good foundation on DS&A, start practicing with Blind75, Grind75, and others. Solutions could be found in [source/problems/leetcode](source/problems/leetcode/) - seach with leetcode id (e.g https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/ is **3**)
4. Recognize the patterns 
5. Get ready and kill the interviews

- [Algorithms & Data strucuture Cheatsheet](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/)

### Pick A Language and Stick With It
I'd strongly recommend [Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/?ref=ghm) due to its simplicity and syntax sugar. Also, it supports a wide range of built-in data structures which are super convenient for coding interviews (e.g [heapq](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html))

### P0 Data Structures
- Array
- Stack & Queue 
- LinkedList 
- Heap
- Tree, Binary Search Tree, Balanced BST, Trie
- Hash Table
- Graph
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set)

*Implemented in Python in [source/data_structure](source/data_structure/)*

### P0 Algorithms
- Sorting: insertion sort, selection sort, heap sort, shell short, merge sort, quick sort, radix sort, bucket sort, etc
- Searching: binary search
- DFS/BFS/Topological Sort
- Shortest Path: Dijktra, Bellman-ford, Floy (optional)

*Implemented in Python in [source/algorithms](source/algorithms/)*

### Technique 
- Brute-force
- Divide and Conquer 
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Recursion / Backtracking
- Bit manipulation
- Tree traversal
- Sliding Windown
- Precomputation
- Greedy

### Patterns

1. Sliding Window

   To perform an operation and keep two pointers on a specific/dynamic window size. Start from 1st on the left and keep shifting to right, and adjust the length of the window accordingly. In a sliding window, the two pointers usually move in the same direction will never overtake each other.

   [Code Template](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/discuss/26808/here-is-a-10-line-template-that-can-solve-most-substring-problems)

2. Two pointers

   Two Pointers is a pattern where two pointers iterate through the data structure in tandem until one or both of the pointers hit a certain condition. Two Pointers is often useful when searching pairs in a sorted array or linked list; for example, when you have to compare each element of an array to its other elements.

   Two pointers can be in the same array/list or different. Usually, we compare value at 2 pointers and/or increment (left -/right +) when relevant

3. Fast & slow pointers

   A special variant of 2 pointers. Fast pointer's speed is 2x of slow pointer. Typically to detect cyclic sequence

4. Merge intervals

   A popular problem of this kind of problenm is time scheduling. to merge time that overlap with each others. Usually can be solved by greedy alogrithm

5. Linked list manipulation

   There are a wide range of problems that involves linked list and manipulate nodes on linked list. A popular example could be reversing linked list (this is almost a meme lol)

6. DFS and BFS on trees/graphes

   They are 2 most important algorithms in set of trees and graphes, appeared in almost every tree/graph problems

7. Using heap to find min/max

   Heap is an important data structure, it's key for priority queue and most problems related to scheduling or optimize timeline will involve heap.

8. Prefix sum: where we can optimize an result by previously calculated results in a sequence 

### Practical Tips To Solve Any Problems
1. Practice
2. Practice more 
3. Repeat 

**On a side note:** Try applying Hash Table / Graphs / Stack & Queue / Heap / Binary Tree when getting stuck

Most important algirthms & data structures are DFS/BFS, Heap (heapify), Hash Table, Binary Search

Try to find a way to improve time complexity. Most common time complexity
- O(1)
- O(log(n))
- O(n)
- O(n*log(n))
- O(n^2)
- O(n^3) 
- O(2^n) 
- O(n!) <-- This is commonly the worst time complexity for problems in coding interviews (except some NP-hard problems)

Use...
- Hash Table to improve search efficiency O(1) on average assuming a good hash func is used
- Binary Search whenever a pre-condition is a sorted array
- Graph to model a problem to a graph problem when entities have inter-connection
- Heap when there is priorization involved (find min, find max, etc)
- Tree to improve insertion/removal/lookup efficiency - O(log(n)) on average. 

Know how to analyze time complexity will be very helpful. There are a few common formulas used for complexity analysis.

To optimize Space Complexity. Try...
- In-place modification on exisiting space
- Avoid duplicated memories. E.g think twice we really need an extra array to do the job instead of a simple variable 

### Interview Hacks
- Ask interviewers if you can assume some validation (input correctness, etc). That saves huge amount of time to avoid writing extra code in the interviews
- Always ask questions / clarify doubts BEFORE jumping into implementation 
- Communicate the approach with interviewers - THINK OUT LOUD
- Write CLEAN code and be collaborative (communicate your thought process throughfully)
- Test your code with a few test cases and state edge cases
- State tradeoffs between different approaches (time vs. space)
- It'll surprise the interviewers if you know some advanced DS&A like [Fibonacci Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap) which is far optimal (also is harder to implement) than Binary Heap in insertion - O(1), or [Skip List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list) which have average search/insert/delete as O(log n) - compared to O(n) of array/list
