### 1. Interval scheduling
Solved by `greedy algorithm`.

Greedy algorithm is a myopic algorithm that process the input one piece at the time with no parent lookahead. 

We try to maximize/minimize the very first thing we can. Looking at the small part of the problem and decide what to do, then we can solve a smaller problem as we solve a part of it

```python
# pick the earliest finish time :) 
def time_scheduling(intervals):
    sorted_intervals = sorted(interval, key=lambda tup: tup[1])
    count = 0
    prev = None
    for interval in sorted_intervals:
        if prev is None or interval[0] >= prev[1]:
            prev = interval
            count+=1

    return count
```
