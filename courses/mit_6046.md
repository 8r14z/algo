### 1. Interval scheduling
Solved by `greedy algorithm`.

Greedy algorithm is a myopic algorithm that process the input one piece at the time with no parent lookahead. 

We try to maximize/minimize the very first thing we can. Looking at the small part of the problem and decide what to do, then we can solve a smaller problem as we solve a part of it

Time scheduling: [implementation](../source/problems/time_sheduling.py)

### 2. Divide and Conquer
Given a problem of size N, divide it into "a" subproblems of size n/b. Solve each subproblem recursively. Combine solutions of subproblems into overall solution
