### 1. Interval scheduling
Solved by `greedy algorithm`.

Greedy algorithm is a myopic algorithm that process the input one piece at the time with no parent lookahead. 

We try to maximize/minimize the very first thing we can. Looking at the small part of the problem and decide what to do, then we can solve a smaller problem as we solve a part of it

```python
# pick the earliest finish time :) the follow up interval gotta have start time >= finish time of previous one
def time_scheduling(intervals):
    sorted_intervals = sorted(interval, key=lambda tup: tup[1])
    count = 0
    prev = None
    for interval in sorted_intervals:
        if prev is None or interval[0] >= prev[1]:
            prev = interval
            count+=1

    return count
```

```python
def weight_time_scheduling(intervals):
    sorted_intervals = sorted(intervals, key=lambda tup: tup[1])
    n = len(intervals)
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[n-1] = sorted_intervals[n-1][2]
    
    def find_compatible(i, intervals) -> int: 
        n = len(intervals)
        left = i + 1
        right = n - 1
        f = intervals[i][1]
        res = n

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left+right)//2
            s = intervals[mid][0] 
            if s > f:
                res = min(res, s)
                right = mid - 1
            elif s < f:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                return mid
        return -1 if res == n else res

    res = float('-inf')
    for i in reversed(range(n-1)):
        compatible_index = find_compatible(i, sorted_intervals)
        w = sorted_intervals[i][2]
        dp[i] = w if compatible_index == -1 else w + sorted_intervals[compatible_index][2]
        res = max(res, dp[i])
    return max
```
