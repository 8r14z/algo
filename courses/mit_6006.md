Pro-tip: watch at 1.75 speed

### 1. Algorithmic Thinking, Peak Finding
Big O: The upper bound. Guarantee that the algorithm will run faster (below) than this

Big Omega: The lower bound, the algorithm is always running slower than this

Big Theta: represent both lower bound and upper bound and 2 bounds are differentiated by constant factor of the dominant factor in function

**g(x) = 1.1 x<sup>2</sup> + x<sup>1.5</sup> + 1000**

Big Theta is Î¸(x<sup>2</sup>) and lower bound is x<sup>2</sup>, upper bound is 1.2x<sup>2</sup> as 1.2 > 1.1 and 1.1 x<sup>2</sup> is dominant factor g(x)

In most cases, Big Theta and Big O are using interchangably, most of the time we talking about Big O in engineering industry, it's the tighest bound of the algorithm and usually it means the same thing as Big Theta in academic.

**A peak in 1-D array**
A peak is the number that larger than or equal the number in index-1 and index+1
-> Binary search, to find a peak. If mid < left, go(a[0:left]), else if mid < right, go(a[mid+1, n]), else return mid

**A peak in 2-D array**
Matrix N x M. Binary search on columns, start at m = M/2 find the max on the column m at (i,j), move left if a[i][j-1] > a[i][j], move right if a[i][j+1] > a[i][j] 

Explain: for example when moving left to column j-1, the find max on column j-1, the max is always greater than its right as it's it greater than the a[i][j-1] and a[i][j-1] > max of j

### 2. Models of Computation, Document Distance

### 3. Insertion Sort, Merge Sort
Insertion Sort can be more efficient as nlog(n) complexity by using binanry search while comparing a new item to the sorted list. Insertion Sort does 2 things to sort the array: compare an item with the previous items and swap.

This is called **Binary Insertion Sort**. In the end, the complexity for this algo still be O(n^2) but the constant factor for comparation as comparing will cost more than swap. 
- Comparation cost: O(nlogn)
- Swapping cost: O(n^2)
- Worst case: O(n^2)

### 4. Heaps and Heap Sort
Heap: An array visualized as a complete binary tree

Application: priority queue, heap sort,...

- parent(i) = i/2
- left(i) = i*2 + 1
- right(i) = i*2 + 2 (if existed)

Max heap: parent >= its children

Pre-condition of heapify at a node: subtree rooted at its left and right children are max-heaps

=> Heap build routine starts from the end towards the begin -> more exactly it starts from node n/2 - 1 to avoid unnecessary work on leaf nodes. 

Insert: add to end of array and swap upward the parent. 
```python
while a[i//2] < a[i]:
    a[i//2], a[i] = a[i], a[i//2]
    i = i//2
```

### 5. Binary Search Trees (BST)
https://youtu.be/9Jry5-82I68

#### Characteristics of BST
- left node <= parent node
- right node > parent node

OR 

- left node < parent node
- right node >= parent node

#### Traversals
- Pre-order: node -> left -> right
- In-order: left -> node -> right
- Post-order: left -> right -> node

Augumented BST: add extra key in to each node that holds number of nodes below it. Modify when inserting or deleting. Similar approach is used to buid balanced BST AVL by storing height of substree instead of number of nodes

### 6. AVL Trees, AVL Sort
Height of tree = length of the longest path from root down to a leaf \
Height of a node = length of the longest path from it down to a lead

height(node) = max(height(left), height(right)) + 1

AVL invariant: height of left & right children of every node to differ by at most +/- 1
=> maintain the balance.

AVL Sort:
- Insert n elements into tree -> O(nlogn)
- in-order traversal -> O(n)

### 7. Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Lower Bounds for Sorting
To sort big array with small integers in linear time. 

#### Counting sort
Sort a list of integers have value between [0, k]. By using an empty array of k elemnts, and mark found emelements by +1 at a[i].

Final step is to iterate the k array to form the output.

```python
L = [0] * (k + 1) 
for i in range(n):
    L[a[i]].append(a[i])

output = []
for i range(k+1):
    output += L[i] 
```

=> Time complexity = O(n + k)

#### Radix sort
Sort a list of integers

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/lecture-videos/MIT6_006F11_lec07.pdf

**Step 1. Decompose each integer into set of digits as base b**

For example:
```python
num = 10
digits = []
while num != 0:
    digits.append(num%b)
    num /= b
```
num of digits of an integer k = `d` = log<sub>b</sub>(k) + 1

Time complexity = O(n * d) = O(n * O(log<sub>b</sub>(k))

-> The key of this step is to find `d`. Can interate the array to find max and decompose d from max -> O(n). Then extract digit by mod in O(1)

**Step 2. Sort all integers by least significant digit (most left digit),..., sort all integers by most significant degit (most right digit)**

```python
for i in range(d): 
    for j in range(n):
        # countingSort a[0][i] -> a[n-1][i]

```

Sort using counting sort to sort and list of integers having value between [0, b]. Time complexity to sort ints by each digits = O(n + b)

Total time for this step = O(d * (n + b)) = O(log<sub>b</sub>(k) * (n + b))

Min. when (b == n) then O(nlog<sub>n</sub>(k))

if (k <= n<sup>c</sup>) then O(n.c) (c: constant)

[Implementation](../source/algorithms/radix_sort.py)

### 8. Hashing with Chaining
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)

Direct-access table:
- Keys may not be integers
- giantly wastful memory 

Hash table:
- prehash: maps keys to possitive integers
- Reduce universe of all keys down to reasonable size m for table

Resolve collision with chaining: use an assumption called "Simple uniform hashing" -> each key is likely to be hashed correctly. one key map to one slot 

So the expected length of chain for n keys and m slots = n/m = a if m = O(n) => chain length = 1. So the time to search on hash table with chaining is O(a)

#### Load Factor
$\alpha$ = n/k where
- n: the number of entities
- k: the number of buckets in hash table

The performance of the hash table deteriorates in relation to the load factor $\alpha$. Therefore a hash table is resized or rehashed if the load factor $\alpha$ approaches 1. A table is also resized if the load factor drops below certain amount. Acceptable figures of load factor $\alpha$ include 0.6 and 0.75.

- Python load factor: 2/3
- Java load factor: 0.75

#### Collision Resolution
- Separate chaining (link-list, BST, dynamic perfect hashing)
- Open Addressing (linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing)

### 9. Table Doubling, Karp-Rabin
Grow table: m -> m'
- Build new table of size m'
- Build new hash function h'
- rehash all items in m to m'

Recommended: m' = 2m => table doubling

Search substring "Karp-Rabin": have substring S and message M. Find S in M
- hash(S) = h
- Loop through M from i = 0 -> len(M)-len(S). At each step, calculates hash of substring [i, i+len(S)-1] = h'
- Compare h and h'
- hash function is using 'Rolling Hash'

### 10. Open Addressing, Cryptographic Hashing
Probling until there is an available slot
- hash(key, 1) -> occupied
- hash(key, 2) -> occupied
- ...........
- hash(key, m-1) -> available

**Insert**: probing till there is available slot - "None" slot

**Search**: probing till found the key or "None" slot

**Delete**: search for the key and replace the deleted item with "DeleteMe" flag, this flag is treated as "non-None" slot while searching but "None" while inserting

#### Probing strategies
- Linear hashing: if h(key, i) is occupied -> try h(key,i+1) and so on. 
- Double hashing: if h(key, i) is occupied, do the second hashing with different hash func to find new slot

#### Cryptographic Hashing
One-way hashing: having q = hash(x), it's very hard to find x from q

### 13. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
#### Graph
```
G = (V.E)
```
- V: set of vertices
- E: set of edges

#### Graph Application
- Web crawling
- Social networking
- Network broadcast
- Garbage collection
- Model checking
- Solve rubic cube 

#### Presentation of graph
- Adjacency list
```
{
    a : {b, c},
    b : {a, c},
    c : {a, b, d}
}
```
{b,c} is the degree of a, sum of all degrees of all nodes we will have 2E (handshaking lemma)

At each node v, we travel v + v's degrees. So the complexity =  sum(v<sub>i</sub> + degree(v<sub>i</sub>)) => O(V + sum(degree(V))) = O(V + 2E) = O(V + E)

The complexity to travel to all nodes and their degrees will be O(V + 2E)

Space Complexity for graph: O(V + E)

- Adjacency matrix
```
  0 1 2 3 
0 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
2 ...
3 ...
```
0 means no connection, 1 means there is a connection between 2 vertices

We gotta travel from one node to all others even when they are not connected  (a[i][j] = 0).

Time Complexity to travel to all nodes: O(V<sup>2</sup>)

Space Complexity for graph: O(V<sup>2</sup>). Can represent in bits as the value is either 0 or 1

`Trade off: time vs. space`

#### Handshaking Lema
Undirected graph: each edge contribute 2 degrees to 2 nodes. Total number of degrees of all nodes are 2 times number of edges. 

Directed graph: each node has in degree and out degree. sum of in degrees + sum of out degress = 2.E. `sum of in degrees = sum of out degress` - each edge contribute 1 out degree to one node and 1 in degree to another node. 

#### BFS
Shortest path in unweighted graph from start node to all the nodes

Time complexity: 
- Adjacency list -> O(V + E). Space O(V + E)
- Adjacency matrix -> O(V<sup>2</sup>). Space: O(V<sup>2</sup>) bits

**WARNING** memorize visited nodes to avoid duplicates and deadlock (run forever), and avoid wrong result on on undirected graph or directed graph with cycle (potentially revisit already visited nodes)

[Implementation](../source/algorithms/bfs.py)
 
Save parent of v to back track for 'a' shortest path (there could be multiple paths) 
```
parent = {}
parent[start] = None

end > parent[end] > parent[parent[end]] > .... > start
```

The length of the shortest path is the level of the leaf node (last node in the path). 
```
level[i] = level[parent[i]] + 1

s -> adj[s]...   
      ^ 
reach adjacencies of s in 1 level
```

### 14. Depth-First Search (DFS), Topological Sort
#### DFS
Similar to BFS, starts from an indicated node to all others

DFS might not find the shortest path due to memorized property of DFS. But it could be possible if we run DFS for the whole graph and update the latest value -> this seems to be applied only when we tryna find something if it exists :) 

Recursively explore graph, backtracking as necessary OR use stack

Memorize visited nodes to avoid duplications

Time complexity: 
- Adjacency list -> O(V + E). Space O(V + E)
- Adjacency matrix -> O(V<sup>2</sup>). Space: O(V<sup>2</sup>) bits

[Implementation](../source/algorithms/dfs.py)

#### Edge Classification
- Forward edge: an edge where a node has connection to its descendant
- Backward edge: an edge where a node has connection to its ancestor
- Cross edge: all others, an edge connects sibling nodes in the graph tree

{
    a : {b, d},
    b : {c},
    c : {d},
    d : {b}
} 

a -> d: forward edge

d -> b: backward edge

```python
# naive -> travel the parent list to find the relationship
if b in a.neighbors:
    if b in a.ascendant:
        return backward
    elif b in an.descendant:
        return forward
    else
        return crossEdge
```
Child node means a node put later on DFS. For example DFS put `a` to the tree, and later `d`, a->d is a shortcut in the tree

There is no forward edge in un-directed graph as the time a node is reached it can't visit its ascendant nodes again (there is no direct to constraint this)

#### Cycle detection
Graph has a cycle if a DSF routine has a backward edge. Backward egde is when a node point to its ancestors

To detect this, we need to keep track of the current DFS routine stack, keep all nodes in the current recursion tree. If a node has a connection to an already exisited node in the stack, it's a backward edge -> cycle

[Implementation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-cycle-in-a-graph/)

Have list to check whether a node is finished or not. A node is finished when all its neighbors are finished. For example:
```
A -> B -> C
     | -> D
``` 
finished = [C, D, B, A]

```python
def is_cyclic(node, parent, finished):
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in parent:
            parent[neighbor] = node
            if is_cyclic_at_node(neighbor):
                return True
        elif neighbor not in finished:
            # neightbor is visited and is not finished -> it's an ancestor -> cycle
            return True
    finished.add(node)
    return False
```

#### [Topological Sort](https://youtu.be/AfSk24UTFS8?t=2727)
Problem: given directed acyclic (no cycle) graph, order vertices so that all edges point from lower oder to higher order.

-> Run DFS, output reverse of finishing times of vertices

This is a job scheduling problem. Start visiting by DFS, till we reach the end, so we can back track as the end node (e) is the job needed to be done first and parent[e] > parent[parent[e]]

e has nothing depends on it -> it's safe to start with e first then e's parent

**WARNING** Need to run DFS to detect the cycle first :) it doesnt work with a cycle 

```python
def dfs(start, graph):
    parent = {}
    finished = []
    parent[start] = None
    dfs_visited(start, parent, finished, graph)

    print(finished[::-1]) # topological order S -> end

def dfs_visit(start, parent, finished, graph):
    for node in graph.neighbors(start):
        if node is not in parent:
            parent[node] = start
            dfs_visit(node, parent, finished, graph)
    finished.append(start)

# finished is the order of finishing time 
```

#### Generic Implementation for DFS/BFS
```python
# For graph travel and memorization, we can use the hash to memorize the parent of the visited node and then we can use that to back track the path other than using it to check the visited status only.
# has parent == visited. 

parent = {}
parent[start] = None

stack/queue.append(start)

while stack/queue:
    node = stack.pop()/queue.popLeft()
    neighbors = graph[node]
    for neighbor in neighbor
        if neighbor not in parent:
            parent[neighbor] = node
            stack/queue.append(neighbor)
```

### 15. Single-Source Shortest Paths Problem
#### Dijstra
Disallow negative weight and cycle

If you have negative weight edges, you might also have negative weight cycles => may make certain shortest paths undefined! -> deadlock in the cycle

Complexity: O(VlogV + E)

#### Bellmen-ford
Positive/negative weight. Bellmen-Ford can detect neagtive cycle

Complexity: O(V.E)

Graph with negative weight example: social network, like is positive, dislike is negative

### 16. Dijkstra
Shortest path from one node to all the others on weighted graph. Disallow negative edge

**NOTE** \
Topological sort the given graph -> we have a list of vertices that neeeds to be done in exact order. This applies while we dont have any specific start node and commit that we can find shortest path from one start node to all others. If u start from random node, it might not happen as there maybe a node the random dom can't reach

Implementation is similar to BFS using priority queue(BTS or heap). We need to keep track of cost at each node and its parent used to backtrack the shortest path and check whether a node is processed or not. A node while processing update cost for its neightbors and then mark it as processed and jump to process the next lowest cost node (in prority queue) 

Dijkstra is a kind of greedy algorithm. It find a node the lowest cost at a given time and update cost to reach its neighbors if the cost is not computed or simply more optimal to go from the current node.

Because of being a greed algorithm (means focus on optimize the current step), having negative weight cycle will make Dijkstra wrong as once a node is processed it will never being processed again...even there is a cheap cost to reach that node with negative weight neighbor...we might think we don't we just keep processing it...well if we dont mark one as done, we might end up processing 4ever with cycle. For example: A->B->C->A

=> Have negative weight, or even worst negative cycle will make the algorithm run incorrectly. With non-cycle negative weight, in some case it works where we are lucky to get a better cost in first-time visiting a node (it can be worse or better depending on the node is visited earlier or later -> very unpredictable)...but most of the time it won't...SO NO! Please yield error in case a cycle is detected...

A -> B: -5
A -> C: 2
B -> C: 3

=> For negative weight cycle, it's better to use Bellman-Ford

```python
def dijkstra(graph, start):
    parent = {start: None}
    cost = {start: 0}
    queue = fibonacciheap(start, graph) # assume we have Fibonacci Heap ADT

    while queue:
        a = queue.extractmin()
        for b, distance in graph.neighbors(a):
            if b not in cost or cost[a] + distance < cost[b]:
                cost[b] = cost[a] + distance
                parent[b] = a
                queue.update(b, cost[b])
    
    return cost, parent

# use priority queue make it O(VlogV + ElogV)
# USE Fibonacci heap to make the update O(1) and O(logN) for extracting
# so the complexity if using Fi heap is O(VlogV + E)
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap
# the above assumes the graph is reprepsented adjacency list. adjacency matrix will make it V^2 -> seems the adjacency matrix presentation is much better in term of space and time 
# for connected componment graph E ~ V^2 so can bound the complexity and discard V from the complexity as E is dominant factor
```

We can use Dijkstraâs algorithm for shortest paths for graphs with negative weights â one idea can be, calculate the minimum weight value, add a positive value (equal to absolute value of minimum weight value) to all weights and run the Dijkstraâs algorithm for the modified graph.

#### Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
Works for DAG with negative edges but without any cycle :) no cycle at all even negative or possitive cycle. 

1. Topologically sort the DAG. Path from u to v implies that u is before v in the
linear ordering.
2. One pass over vertices in topologically sorted order relaxing each edge that
leaves each vertex.

Î(V + E) time

This algorithm doesnt work for any source. After topological sort, it only commits to get the shortest path from the first element of the sorted array (as the source) to the end. 

The relaxation is from one vertice to its neighbors and then go to the next vertice (one by one over vertices in topologically ordered array). 

### 17. Bellman-Ford
Bellman-Ford can detect negative cycle and report. Bellman-Ford is different from Dijkstra that it can work with negative-weight or negative cycle, it wont give the answer for such cases as the answer will be wrong anw, but will report if there is a fraud detected (-w, -c)

```python
def bellmanford(graph, start):
    parent = {start: None}
    cost = {start, 0}

    V = len(graph.vertices)
    # A simple shortest path from src to any other vertex can have at-most |V| - 1 edges 
    for _ in range(1, V):
        for v in graph.vertices:                # *1
            for u, distance in v.neighbors:     # *2
                if u not in cost or cost[u] < cost[v] + distance:
                    cost[u] = cost[v] + distance
                    parent[v] = a
    
    # *1 + *2 = E

    for v in graph.vertices:
        for u, dist in v.neighbors:
            # never reached u or wrong cost 
            if u not in cost or cost[u] > cost[v] + distance:
                return None, None # contains negative cycles

    return cost, parent

```

`A simple shortest path from src to any other vertex can have at-most |V| - 1 edges`

To find the longest path, we know how to find the shortest path with Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford, so we can just revert the sign of weight (i.e: 1 -> -1, 2 -> -2, and so on) and find the longest path with Bellman-Ford. Dijstra doesn't work with negative weight -> can work around by adding a floor value of the min cost to (-5,1,2) -> (0, 6, 7)

#### Find Shortest Path in negative-cyclic graph
If there is a nagative weight cycle in the graph, finding shortest path path is a NP-hard problem (super hard problem). 

In case of graph, no algorithm is better than Generic SP. algorithm - exponential time to solve this. This also potentially loops forever. In Generic SP. algorithm, it will relax all other nodes when the cost to a node is changed. E.g change in v<sup>i</sup> will make v<sup>i+n</sup> changed. So the changes are factored by weight of edges and weight range can be exponetial. It's different from Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford, `w` of edges are not considered in the complexity, they are taking into account number of edges and number of vertices. 

The exponetial complexity of Generic algorithm could come from bad choices of edges, which is impossible to know what a good choice is without brute-force...But practically there is no better solution for that situation. For most common problems, we can use Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford.

### 18. Speed up Dijkstra: Single source, single target
Simple search:
- Have graph G, source S, target T. Do Dijkstra and extrac min from priority, stop when T is extraced from queue, then back track to output the path. 

Bi-directional Search: 
- Alternate forward search from S and backward search from T. meaning do Dijkstra forward from S and Dijkstra backward from T. F -> B -> F -> B ->...
- Algorithm terminates when some vertex w has been processed, i.e., deleted from the
queue of both searches, Qf and Qb
- Find node x with minimum value of df (x) + db(x). x may not be the vertex w that caused termination
- Find shortest path from s to x using and shortest path backwards from t to x 

### 19. Dynamic Programming
DP is name of optimization, likes finding minimum or maximum of something in sequence/string/array

#### DP variants
##### 1. Memorized DP algorithm**
```
DP = sub-problems + "reuse" solved sub-problems
```
Complexity = # sub-problems * time/sub-problem

##### 2. Bottom-up DP algorithm**
Think of recursion tree and build upward. Start from basecase to root. Do topological sort of subproblem depedendency DAG

Topological sort: \
F<sub>1</sub> <- ... <- F<sub>n-2</sub> <- F<sub>n-1</sub> <- Fib<sub>n</b>

Subproblems dependencies should be acyclic

DP can be solved by observing topological sort (A depends on B to finish -> solve B first and save the result then solve A). You dont need memorization if u can do it in topological sort. The hardest part is to find the formula.

Find shortest path from S to T can use topological sort. Path from S to T is S -> v -> u -> T. So to find the shortest path(S,T) -> we topologically solve it by path(S,T) = path(S,u) + edge(u, T), path(S,u) = path(S,v) + edge(v,u), and so on...

In case there are multiple parent nodes of T, u, u1, u2, u3,.. so we can chagne the formula by get min(path(S,u) + edge)(u,T), path(S,u1) + edge)(u1,T), path(S,u2) + edge)(u2,T), ...)

DAG -> topological sort -> bottom up (i.e Fibonacci)

##### 3. Parent pointers**
Remember which guest is best

#### Definition
```
DP = carefull brute force = guessing + recursion + memorization 
```
DP = shortest paths in some DAG

#### 5 easy steps
1. define subproblems, then count # problems
2. guess how to solve the problem and what state is, then count # choices for a subproblem, number of ways to solve a subproblem
3. relate subproblem solutions -> recurrence/formula of DP, how to connect those problems together. \
Calculate time/subproblem. \
min/max of choices + work of current
4. recurse & memorize (subproblem recurrence is acyclic) OR DP table bottom-up (topological order)
5. solve original problem. May/May not need extra cost \
The solution is first or last element -> O(1) \
The solution is comparing multiple subproblems -> interate to find. i.e min/max -> O(n)

```
Best-tip: Find topological sort and interate from there. Topological sort is the dependency graph, so one should be completed before another
```

Subproblems for input as strings or sequences
- suffixes x[i:] -> topological order right to left (decreasing i)
- prefixes x[:i] -> topological order left to right (increasing i)
- substrings x[i:j] i <= j -> increasing substring size (small -> large substrings)

2 kinds of guessing (Step 2)
- guessing which subproblem to use to solve bigger problem
- guessing by adding more subproblems to guess/remember more (ie. knapsack, we need to keep track of the size after adding/removing an item so it's [i][j] instead of [i] for subfix/prefix problems)
