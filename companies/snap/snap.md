### Process
- 1 Phone interview
- Virtual onsite: 5 rounds (2-3 coding rounds , 1 system design, 1 culture fit/behavioral questions)

### Behavioral Questions
- Tell me about your most challenging project and what you did in it?

### Coding interviews
Mixed reviews from Glassdoor and Blind on coding interviews. Typically, it will 
include LC-type questions medium/hard (can ramp up with LC Snap tagged), iOS trivia, 

Sample questions (sourced Glassdoor & Blind)
- Serialize and deserialize a binary tree.
- Number of islands (leetcode 200)
- Given a labyrinth matrix of traversable/non-traversable elements, find if it's possible to go from the top-left element to the bottom right
- Basic algorithm problems like bfs and hash table.
- It was a coding question involving a trie.
- Median sorted arrays
- Hard leetcode question. Related topic is String
- Max sum root to leaf
- There is a list with words like: pin, pine, apple, pineapple. Go through the list and figure out which words are combinations of other words in the list, and which ones aren't
- Question about Strings and how to store certain aspects of the review.
- Basic calculator III Leetcode 772
- Merge array of sorted intervals of time
- Find max amount of rain water you can trap on top of a building
- I was given the problem to write code to find the number of instances of an integer in a sorted int array.
- Implement an autocomplete function using a Trie.
- In a matrix consisting of '1' and '0'. '1' is walkable and '0' is blocked. Give you a start point and an end point, ask you how many steps you can reach end point from the start point.
- Given a target number and a single number, write a program to find the shortest path to calculate the target number by applying "+-*/" operations to the single number. No parentheses. For example, if we have target number=26 and single number=3 return 3 * 3 * 3 - 3 / 3.

### System Design
- Design the discovery page. Got deep into multithreading for loading pics. Know how to implement infinite scroll
- "Twitter feed", "IG feed", "list -> detail view", etc.

### iOS-domain topics
- Know iOS memory management
- Know Xcode Instruments and when to use them
- Know UITableView and UICollectionView + data structures and your data sources
- Pros/Cons of Delegation, NSNotification, KVO
- Separation of concerns, modularization, protocols, explicit types and initialization of classes, how are certain classes referenced by others?
- Multithreading
- Runtime

### Tips
- Start simple, always be talking and looking for acceptance before continuing. - - Try not to explain something beyond your understanding. At a few years of experience, it's more dangerous to try reach to far in your explanations of best-practices, patterns, etc..
