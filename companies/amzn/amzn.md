## Phone Interview
Phone interview: the same process is applied for all roles :) doesn't matter what kind of role u apply for...

- leveling is done by Amazon :) 
- no need to turn on camera 
- collaborative: solve with the engineer
- 35-40m coding 20m 5 Q&A
- 1 or 2 coding problems - computer science fundamentals
- any languages :) 
- ask clarify questions (always) -> thinking through -> communicate through (why, edge cases) -> start implementing -> clean code -> testing with couple of samples -> interview gives hints (guide to the right answer) -> no need to compile -> work on medium categories :)
